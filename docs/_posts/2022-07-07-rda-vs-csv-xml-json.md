CSV is perhaps the most widely used text-based data file format. The advantages of CSV are - 

1. Editor friendly
2. Tabular presentation

The disadvantage of CSV are - 
1. Not so fault tolerant, e.g. delimitors and line-break chars will break the data structure.
2. Does not support hierarchical data structure, or higher dimemsional data (i.e. it's limitted to 2D)
